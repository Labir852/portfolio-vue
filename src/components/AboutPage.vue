    <p>
      I am Tanvir Anjum Labir, a Dhaka,Bangladesh based Computer Science and
      Engineering Student/Web Developer @ Primeasia University, with
      never-stopping love for learning new tech. I am specialising in Web
      Development with React.js, Express, MongoDB and Node.js. I am passionate
      about the Internet and how we can design beautiful looking interfaces with
      programming languages.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm currently a final year undergraduate student @ Primeasia University,
      polishing and preparing for being a industry level programmer. I am also
      Revising Data Structures & Algorithms. Before this, I just used to design
      small projects from Frontend Mentor. It has helped me polish my
      web-development skills.
      <br />
      <br />
      I started learning about web-development in my early high-school, where I
      was introduced to HTML and CSS. I quickly started writing small webpages
      with simple HTML and little of CSS. After my high-school, I took some time
      to myself and explored the web development world more and found many
      frameworks. Out of all, I found my love for React.js. Since then, I've
      been mastering it, and with every new project I added a new tool, like
      Material UI, Express and more.

      You can find my projects on my
      <a href="https://github.com/labir852">Github</a> or on my
      <a href="">Portfolio</a> page. I usually don't update my portfolio page
      but all my recent one's are on github.
      <br />
      <br />
      Outside of my worklife, I love to play PUBG, learning about new
      informations related technologies, new environments of the world. I
      usually hangout with my friends and I am active on
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tanvir.labir159/">Facebook</a>, you can
      also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/loverazlabir">Twitter</a> and

      rarely in these social medias, but you will get to know me.
